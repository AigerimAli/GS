<hr>
<p> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>


<p> The <b>German Shepherd</b> (German: <i>Deutscher SchГ¤ferhund</i>, German pronunciation:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German">[Л€dЙ”КЏtКѓЙђ Л€КѓЙ›ЛђfЙђЛЊhКЉnt]</a>) is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. According to the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FГ©dГ©ration_Cynologique_Internationale">FCI</a>, the breed's English language name is <b>German Shepherd Dog</b>. The breed name was officially known as the "Alsatian Wolf Dog" in the UK from after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">First World War</a> until 1977 when its name was changed back to German Shepherd.
Despite its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf">wolf</a>-like appearance, the German Shepherd is a relatively modern breed of dog, with its origin dating to 1899.

<p>As a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding_dog">herding dog</a>, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep">sheep</a>.
Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including <a href="

<h3> Description </h3>
<hr>
<p> German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.The breed standard height at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withers">withers</a> is 60вЂ“65 cm (24вЂ“26 in) for males, and 55вЂ“60 cm (22вЂ“24 in) for females.German Shepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1вЃ„2. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the

</center>
<p> German Shepherds have a double <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_coat">coat</a> which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)">recessive</a>, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verband_fГјr_das_Deutsche_Hundewesen">German</a> and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club. The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.</p>

<p>Most commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most color varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic "saddle" to an overall "blanket". Rarer color variations include the sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.</p>

<h4> Intelligence </h4>
<p> German Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.</p>

<h3> Temperament </h3>
<hr>
<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Infant_with_two_German_Shepherds.JPG" alt="German Shepherd" width="160" height="100">

<p>German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured. The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers. German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.</p>

<h4> Aggression and biting </h4> 
<p>A 2020 literature review in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found that from 1971 to 2018 of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the German Shepherd, was responsible for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment.</p>

<p>While an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales, once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of GSD attacks drops to 38th.</p>

<p>According to the National Geographic Channel television show Dangerous Encounters, the bite of a German Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238 lbf) (compared with that of a Rottweiler, over 1,180вЂ“1,460 newtons (265вЂ“328 lbf), a Pit bull, 1,050 newtons (235 lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000 newtons (230 lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86 lbf)).</p>

<h3> Modern breed </h3>
<hr>
<p>The modern German Shepherd breed is criticized by some for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.</p>

<h4> Controversy </h4>
<p>The Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.</p>


<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/GSD-Metrics.svg" alt="German Shepherd" width="180" height="140">
<p>The debate was catalyzed when the issue was raised in the BBC documentary, Pedigree Dogs Exposed, which said that critics of the breed describe it as "half dog, half frog." An orthopedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were "not normal."</p>

<p>The Kennel Club's position is that "this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement."The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalize dogs suffering these problems.</p>

<p>The Kennel Club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.</p>

<h3> Variants </h3>
<hr>
<p><b>East-European Shepherd</b></p>

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Vostochno_Evropeiskaya_Ovcharka.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="170" height="110">
<p>The East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the former Soviet Union with the purpose of creating a larger, more cold resistant version of the German Shepherd; it lacks the physical deformities bred into western show lines of German Shepherds and has become one of Russia's most popular dog types.</p>

<p><b>King Shepherd </b></p> 
<p>The King Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States, its breeders hoping to rectify the physical deformities that have been bred into the original breed.</p>

<p> <b>Shiloh Shepherd </b></p>

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Plushcoatshilohshepherd.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="170" height="110">

The Shiloh Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern German Shepherds, and was bred for large size, length of their back, temperament and soundness of hips.It has been recognized by the American Rare Breed Association since 1990.

<p> <b> White Shepherd </b> </p>

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Kandestack_62406.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="170" height="110">

<p>The White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. White coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the colouration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white coloured German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd. The variety is recognized as a separate breed by the United Kennel Club.</p>

<p><b> White Swiss Shepherd Dog</b></p>

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Berger_Blanc_Suisse.png"  alt="German Shepherd" width="170" height="110">

<p>The White Swiss Shepherd Dog (French: Berger Blanc Suisse, German: Weisser Schweizer SchГ¤ferhund, Italian: Pastore Svizzero Bianco) is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland. It descends from the American White Shepherds; the first stud dog of what became the breed was an American dog born in 1966 and imported to Switzerland. The variety was recognised by the FГ©dГ©ration Cynologique Internationale as a separate breed in 2003, and it is now recognised by a number of national kennel clubs.</p>

<h3> Use as a working dog </h3>
<hr>
<p> German Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. Usually trained for scout duty, they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.</p>

<p>German Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.</p>

<p>One Mexican German Shepherd, Zuyaqui, was dissected and his body put on display at the Sedena's "Narco Museum" in Mexico. He is regarded to be the dog who has captured the most drugs in Mexican police and military history.</p>

<h3> History </h3>
<hr>
<p>In 2018, a genetic study found that, just prior to 1859, a broadly distributed European herding dog had given rise to the German Shepherd Dog, the French Berger Picard, and the five Italian herding breeds: the Bergamasco Shepherd, Cane Paratore, Lupino del Gigante, Pastore d'Oropa, and the Pastore della Lessinia e del Lagorai.</p>


<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/German_Shepherd_Portrait.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="150" height="110" >

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Max_von_Stephanitz.png" alt="German Shepherd" width="150" height="180" >
<p> During the 1850s, attempts were being made to standardize dog breeds.Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.In Germany this was practiced within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognized that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.</p>

<p>To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany. The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.</p>

<h3> Etimology </h3>
<hr>
<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/German_Shepherds_in_ravine.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="150" height="110">
<p>The breed was named Deutscher SchГ¤ferhund by von Stephanitz, literally translating to "German Shepherd Dog". The breed was so named due to its original purpose of assisting shepherds in herding and protecting sheep. At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche SchГ¤ferhunde, or Old German herding dogs.</p>

<p>The direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the official breed registry; however, at the conclusion of World War I, it was believed that the inclusion of the word "German" would harm the breed's popularity,due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to "Alsatian Wolf Dog",after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.</p>

<p>Eventually, the appendage "wolf dog" was dropped, after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality. The name Alsatian remained for five decades,until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds. The word "Alsatian" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name and was removed in 2010.</p>

<h3> Popularity </h3>
<hr>
<p> When the UK Kennel accepted registrations in 1919, 54 German Shepherds were registered. By 1926 this number had grown to over 8,000. The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further. The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring suffered from defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to suffer a decline in popularity during the late 1920s.</p>

<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Fritzi_GSD_puppy.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="150" height="110">

<p>Popularity increased again after the German Shepherd Sieger Pfeffer von Bern became the 1937 and 1938 Grand Victor in American Kennel club dog shows, only to suffer another decline at the conclusion of World War II, due to anti-German sentiment. Popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the United States. As of 2016, the German Shepherd is the second most popular breed in the US. Additionally, the breed is typically among the most popular in other registries. The German Shepherd Dog's physique is very well suited to competing in shows and competitions, such as agility trials.</p>

<h3> Health </h3>
<hr>
<p> Many common ailments of the German Shepherd are a result of the inbreeding practiced early in the breed's life. One such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis. A study conducted by the University of Zurich found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 19.1% of German Shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia. There are, however, ways to help prevent hip dysplasia, including getting a pup from a good breeder, keeping it on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play. German Shepherds have low frequency of ear infections, since this breed is well-known for hyperactivity of its cerumen-producing glands. According to a recent survey in the UK, the median life span of German Shepherds is 10.95 years, which is normal for a dog of their size.</p>


<h4> Skeletal health and supplementation </h4>
<p>Musculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events.[79] Some breeds like the German shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, Cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis. These conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.</p>

<p>Canine hip dysplasia (CHD) is an orthopedic condition resulting from abnormal development of the hip joint and surrounding tissue causing the instability and partial dislocation of the hip joint, resulting in pain, inflammation, lameness, and potentially osteoarthritis of the joint.[80][82] German shepherds are genetically predisposed to CHD and the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.</p>

<p>Osteoarthritis is one of the main contributors of musculoskeletal pain and disabilities that commonly affect German shepherds. Mechanical stress, oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators combine to induce the gradual degeneration of the articular cartilage in the joint, resulting in reduced muscle mass, pain, and locomotion.</p>

<p>Vitamins such as A and D also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism.Adequate levels should be incorporated into a German shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.</p>

<h3> In popular culture </h3>
<hr>
<p> German Shepherds have been featured in a wide range of media. In 1921 Strongheart became one of the earliest canine film stars, and was followed in 1922 by Rin Tin Tin, who is considered the most famous German Shepherd. Both have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>

<p>Batman's dog Ace the Bat-Hound appeared in the Batman comic books, initially in 1955, through 1964. Between 1964 and 2007, his appearances were sporadic.</p>


<img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Strongheart-Rice-1921-cropped.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="150" height="200">

<p>A German Shepherd named Inspector Rex is the star of an Austrian Police procedural drama program of the same name, which won many awards, where German Shepherd Rex assists the Vienna Kriminalpolizei homicide unit. The show was aired in many languages.</p>

<p>KГЎntor was a famous and very successful police dog in Hungary in the 1950s and early 1960s. After his death his story was fictionalized by two crime novels by Rudolf Szamos [hu], titled KГЎntor Investigates and KГЎntor in the Big City . A five-part thriller series for television titled KГЎntor [hu] was produced in 1975, which was loosely based on the actual dog's story, setting the events more than a decade after the real KГЎntor died. </p>
